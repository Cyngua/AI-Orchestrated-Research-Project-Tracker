    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) are severe cardiovascular emergencies requiring urgent intervention. Nephrotic syndrome (NS) increases the risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE), but its exact contribution remains underrecognized.\nCASE ILLUSTRATION: We present three cases of young adults with NS who developed ATE. The first patient had anterior STEMI with high thrombus burden but no significant atherosclerosis, suggesting a thromboembolic event. The second patient, diagnosed with CLTI, had extensive thrombotic occlusions from the infrarenal aorta to the bilateral superficial femoral arteries without atherosclerotic plaques, reinforcing a thromboembolic mechanism. He declined revascularization and was treated with medical therapy, achieving symptom relief. The third patient had CLTI with occlusions in the external iliac and superficial femoral arteries, accompanied by prominent plaque calcification, suggesting an atherosclerotic contribution. He underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with favorable outcomes.\nCONCLUSION: NS predisposes patients to ATE via hypercoagulability and, in some cases, atherosclerosis. Cardiovascular screening should be prioritized in high-risk patients, and preventive measures, including thromboprophylaxis and lipid management, should be considered. Treatment should be individualized based on the predominant mechanism, with deferred stenting in high thrombus burden STEMI and a multidisciplinary approach for CLTI. Long-term follow-up is essential to prevent recurrence.",

    "abstract": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is a ring-shaped pentameric protein synthesized in the liver via CRP gene transcription. It is an inflammatory marker, whose serum levels can be measured using traditional and high-sensitivity tests. In healthy adults, the normal CRP serum concentrations vary between 0.8 mg/L and 3.0 mg/L. These can be grouped into low-, moderate-, and high-risk categories according to CRP levels of less than 1, 1-3, and greater than 3 mg/L, respectively. Elevated levels have been observed in infections, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and malignancies. However, it is not specific to any disease. Serum CRP levels have also been shown to indicate the risk of cardiovascular disease, owing to their role as inflammatory markers in atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and peripheral arterial disease. Furthermore, its role in autoimmune diseases, such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, and its involvement in the development of cancers, including breast, colorectal, ovarian, prostate, and lung cancers, have also been studied. The involvement of CRP in determining the course of infection and differentiating between bacterial and viral infections has also been investigated.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To prospectively examine whether depressive symptoms were associated with higher risks of incident cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in individuals with type 2 diabetes.\nMETHODS: Included were 17,031 participants from UK Biobank with type 2 diabetes who were free of depression (identified by self-reported medical history, hospital record, and antidepressant use), and composite CVD, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and heart failure (HF). Cox proportional hazards models were applied to examine the association between depressive symptoms measured by Patient Health Questionaire-2 (PHQ-2) and incident composite CVD and its subtypes, adjusting for potential confounders.\nRESULTS: During a median follow-up of 12.3 years, we documented 2875 incident composite CVD cases (including 1303 coronary artery disease, 531 ischemic stroke, 530 peripheral arterial disease, and 1142 HF cases). The presence of depressive symptoms had higher risks of composite CVD (adjusted HR, 1.34; 95 % CI, 1.17-1.54) among individuals with type 2 diabetes. Dose-response relationships were observed between depressive symptoms and the composite CVD, ASCVD, and three individual CVD outcomes (P-trend <0.05 for all).\nCONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptoms were associated with a higher risk of CVD events across all degrees of metabolic control and diabetes severity. Dose-response associations were also found between depressive symptoms score and all incident CVD outcomes, except for ischemic stroke, after adjustment for cardiovascular and diabetes-related risk factors. Therefore, simple screening questions regarding depressive symptoms might be applied to people with type 2 diabetes to predict CVD outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Current assessment standards for peripheral arterial disease (PAD), such as the ankle brachial index, are limited in their utility and portability. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has shown some promise in diagnosing PAD when used in conjunction with a provocative maneuver. The purpose of this study was to assess the viability of NIRS in conjunction with a transient leg elevation provocative maneuver for detecting severe PAD. This retrospective observational cross-sectional study assessed 57 limbs in 34 patients receiving routine vascular screening for PAD at Madigan Army Medical Center. The patient limbs were stratified into normal (n = 17), mild (n = 9), moderate (n = 16), and severe (n = 15) PAD groups based on the clinician assessments. Additionally, the patients were assessed with NIRS measurements taken with the patient in the supine position at rest and using a provocative leg raise maneuver of transient leg elevation of 45° for 60 seconds. The resting tissue oxygen saturation (StO) and the change in StO (ΔStO) from rest to elevation were recorded and compared between the PAD severity groups via independent measures analysis of variance with the Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test. The supine resting StO was not different between the normal (77.5% ± 7.7%), mild (72.5% ± 7.4%), moderate (72.0% ± 10.3%), and severe (74.2% ± 5.4%) PAD groups ( = .23). However, the ΔStO with transient leg elevation was significantly greater in the severe PAD group (-17.2% ± 6.0%) compared with the normal (-3.9% ± 4.8%), mild (-6.9% ± 4.7%), and moderate (-9.7% ± 5.2%) PAD groups ( < .002 for all). Similar results were observed in the changes in oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. The leg elevation protocol was also used for two patients before and after lower limb revascularization, which demonstrated that the ΔStO corresponded with the clinical assessment of PAD severity. Resting supine NIRS images were unable to detect any differences among normal and limbs with different PAD severity. However, NIRS imaging with 45° leg elevation for 60 seconds showed a significant difference between severe PAD compared healthy patients and those with mild to moderate PAD in a fast, precise, and accurate manner. These preliminary data support the use of NIRS and transient leg elevation as a tool to diagnose severe PAD but do not support the use of NIRS alone as a screening test for PAD. NIRS measurements with leg elevation might be a viable noninvasive, noncontact, and portable method of assessing severe PAD for home monitoring, in rural communities, and/or in standard clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypervolemia is a prevalent comorbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Thiazide diuretics (THZ) are the most common treatment for volume overload and hypertension (HTN). This study examines the association between THZ usage and clinical outcomes among CKD patients in a nationwide cohort.\nMETHOD: The total number of patients in the study was 24,312. After matching with one non-user randomly selected from the CKD population, we identified 8501 patients in the THZ and the comparison cohorts. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was conducted to estimate the associations of THZ on the incidence of all-cause mortality, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), congestive heart failure (CHF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), and stroke.\nRESULTS: The all-cause mortality rate was significantly lower in THZ users than in non-users (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.60- 0.71). The THZ usage was associated with a lower incidence of ESRD, AMI, PAOD, and stroke (P<0.05). In subgroup analysis, some significant clinical outcomes were related with CKD stages 3 and 4 (P<0.05); however, there were no clinical associations in CKD stage 5. In further THZ subtype analysis, there were clinical associations with fewer deaths, ESRD, AMI, and PAOD accompanying chlorthalidone treatment. Moreover, the indapamide prescription was linked to lower mortality, ESRD, AMI, and PAOD prevalence. However, there were significantly greater incidences of ESRD, CHF, and AMI in the metolazone users.\nCONCLUSION: THZ usage is associated with lower mortality and incidence of ESRD, AMI, PAOD, and stroke s in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4.",

Guidelines for PAD recommend evidence-based medical therapy (EBMT) to reduce the risks of cardiovascular events and death but the implementation of this is highly variable. This study aimed to understand the current practices regarding EBMT prescription in PAD patients and the key barriers and facilitators for implementing PAD guidelines.\nMETHOD: A qualitative study was conducted in the largest tertiary hospital in Singapore from December 2021 to March 2023. The participants included healthcare professionals and in-patient pharmacists involved in the care of PAD patients, as well as patients with PAD who had undergone a lower limb angioplasty revascularisation procedure. Data were collected through in-depth, individual semi-structured interviews conducted face-to-face or remotely by a trained research assistant. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and systematically coded using data management software NVivo 12.0. The Tailored Implementation for Chronic Diseases (TICD) framework was used to guide the interviews and analysis.\nRESULTS: Twelve healthcare professionals (4 junior consultants, 7 senior consultants, and 1 senior in-patient pharmacist) and 4 patients were recruited. Nine themes in 7 domains emerged. Only a small proportion of doctors were aware of the relevant guidelines, and the generalisability of guidelines to patients with complicated conditions was the doctors' main concern. Other barriers included cost, frequent referrals, lack of interprofessional collaboration, not being the patients' long-term care providers, short consultation time and patients' limited medication knowledge.\nCONCLUSION: Findings from this study may inform strategies for improving healthcare professionals' adherence to guidelines and patients' medication adherence.",

    "abstract": "A 52-year-old male developed right knee pain after hiking in Guatemala. On his return he underwent a knee MRI for an indication of medial knee pain, which demonstrated a medial meniscal tear. However, the MRI demonstrated marked tortuosity and dense calcification of the popliteal artery, confirmed on subsequent radiographs. Review of previous CT studies of the abdomen and lower extremities showed severe ectasia and arterial calcification in the femoral and popliteal arteries bilaterally, but no calcifications in the aorta and common iliac arteries. Dual energy CT studies of the extremities demonstrated extensive periarticular soft tissue calcification throughout the wrists, hands, ankle and feet without evidence of uric acid. Review of the electronic medical records revealed a diagnosis of Arterial Calcification due to Deficiency of CD73 (ACDC), a rare genetic disorder presenting with debilitating pain in the wrists and hands, claudication of the calves, thighs and buttocks, progressing to chronic ischemia of the feet which may be limb-threatening. The patient was enrolled in an NIH trial of bisphosphonates and dual-antiplatelet therapy with stabilization of symptoms. This case discusses the imaging findings of this rare condition, differential diagnosis to consider, and current management.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: To explore the dermatological lesions associated with chronic pruritus in patients who were followed up at our clinic for type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 249 patients with DM, who presented to the endocrinology clinic at Ankara University Faculty of Medicine between January 2022, and March 2022, regardless of whether they had reported experiencing pruritus symptoms. The visual analog scale and 5-D itch scale were used to determine the severity of itching in patients. Dermatological examination findings were also evaluated.\nRESULTS: Of the 249 patients with DM, mean duration since diabetes was diagnosed was 12 ± 9.2 [median 10 (0.3-46)] years, and the mean HbA1c levels were 8.1% ± 2.1%. Pruritus was detected in 77 (30.9%) patients and the mean duration of diabetes diagnosis was 13.4 ± 9.7 years. Examination of the microvascular and macrovascular complications showed that the incidence of retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease was 31.2% (p = 0.003), 31.2% (p = 0.005), 66.2% (p < 0.001) and 10.4% (p = 0.038), respectively, in the group with pruritus. These incidences were significantly higher in the group with pruritus than in those without pruritus. Dermatological examination showed that the most common condition was xerosis (64%), followed by fungal skin infection (16%) and bullous pemphigoid (8%). No skin findings were noted in 7% of patients who complained of itching.\nCONCLUSION: Chronic pruritus may be associated with several factors such as poor glycemic control, high BMI and microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients with DM. Especially in patients with severe generalized pruritus who do not respond to standard antipruritic treatments, the use of DPP-4 inhibitors, a class of oral antidiabetic agents, should be questioned and all medications being used by the patient should be reviewed.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop a rabbit iliac stenosis model and evaluate the effects of different mechanical injury techniques on the degree of arterial stenosis.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen rabbits were divided into three groups: cholesterol-fed with pullover balloon injury (group A;  = 6), cholesterol-fed with localized balloon dilatation (group B;  = 6), and chow-diet with pullover balloon injury (group C;  = 6). After baseline angiography, the left iliac arteries of all rabbits were injured with a 3 × 10 mm noncompliant balloon using either a wide pullover technique (groups A and C) or a localized balloon dilatation technique (group B). A nine-week follow-up angiography was performed, and the angiographic late lumen loss and percentage of stenosis were compared.\nRESULTS: Group A exhibited the most severe late lumen loss (A vs. B, 0.67 ± 0.13 vs. 0.04 ± 0.13 mm,  < 0.0001; A vs. C, 0.67 ± 0.13 vs. 0.26 ± 0.29 mm,  < 0.05; stenosis percentage 32.02% ± 6.54%). In contrast, group B showed a minimal percentage of stenosis (1.75% ± 6.55%).\nCONCLUSION: Pullover-balloon injury can lead to significant iliac artery stenosis in rabbits with controlled hypercholesterolemia. This model may be useful for elucidating the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and for evaluating the efficacy of novel therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) is a common and easy-to-use assessment of walking incapacity in people with claudication due to peripheral artery disease (PAD). It has four subscales: pain severity, walking distance, walking speed, and ability to climb stairs. It has not been translated into Gujarati, which limits its use in Indian subjects.\nAIM: This study aims to translate and assess the validity and reliability of a Gujarati version of WIQ.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This study had three phases: 1. Forward and backward translation and Cultural adaptation of WIQ into the Gujarati language by two independent translators, 2. Face and content validation by six clinical reviewers and 10 participants with PAD and Type II diabetes, 3. Concurrent and construct validity, test-retest reliability, and internal consistency of Gujarati, the WIQ was assessed on 160 participants with PAD and Type II diabetes who had a mean Ankle Brachial Index (standard deviation) <0.40 (0.1). The concurrent and construct validity of the WIQ was analyzed by correlating the WIQ distance and speed score with 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) and speed and WIQ total score with the Medical Outcome Study Questionnaire Short Form 36 (SF-36) score using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Test-retest reliability was analyzed using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with a seven-day interval between two questionnaire applications. Internal consistency of the total WIQ score was determined using Cronbach's alpha.\nRESULTS: Following translation, the Gujarati WIQ was considered acceptable and understandable by people with PAD. There was excellent correlation between the WIQ distance score and 6-minute walk test distance (r = 0.95, P < .05)) , the WIQ speed score and 6-minute walk test speed score (r = 0.89, P < .05)) and the Gujarati WIQ total score and total score of physical functioning domain of SF- 36 (r = 0.99, P < .05). There was excellent test-retest reliability over 7 days for total WIQ score (ICC = 0.94). The Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency of 0.97 for total WIQ score were excellent. This demonstrates the sufficient homogeneity of the total questionnaire.\nCONCLUSION: The Gujarati version of the WIQ is reliable and valid and can be used to assess self-reported walking impairment in Gujarati-speaking people with PAD and Type II Diabetes.",

There are few studies describing the mid- and long-term patency of endovascular stents in long-segment FP occlusions.   This study aimed to determine the technical success and mid-term patency of subintimal angioplasty with vasculomimetic stenting in Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II (TASC) C and D FP disease. The patient and imaging factors that affect primary patency were also analyzed.   A single-center prospective study was performed on 52 consecutive patients undergoing endovascular treatment for TASC C and D FP disease from 2017 to 2021.

    "abstract": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one clinical manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis and is very common. Despite its prevalence, PAD remains underdiagnosed, undertreated, and understudied. The most common symptom in patients with PAD is intermittent claudication (IC), or pain in the lower extremities with walking or exertion, which is relieved after a short period of rest. Many patients with confirmed PAD are asymptomatic or have symptoms other than IC. Regardless of symptoms, patients with PAD have poor cardiovascular outcomes. PAD has largely been viewed a disease of large vessel atherosclerosis but what is becoming clear is that arterial plaques and occlusions are only one piece of the puzzle. Recent work has shown that abnormalities in the microvasculature contribute to the outcome of patients with PAD. From the perspective of the leg, limitation in blood flow is not the only problem as patients have a myriad of other problems, including muscle fibrosis, neuropathic changes, changes in the cellular respiration machinery and dysfunction of the small vessels that perfuse skeletal muscle and the supporting structures. Supervised exercise training remains one of the most effective tool to treat patients with PAD, however, the mechanisms behind its effectiveness are still being elucidated and use of structured exercise programs is not widespread. Medical therapy to treat systemic atherosclerosis is underutilized in patients with PAD. Invasive therapies are used only when patients with PAD have reached an advanced stage. While invasive strategies are effective in some patients with PAD, these strategies are costly, carry risk, and many patients are not amenable to invasive therapy. Appreciating the complex pathophysiology of PAD will hopefully spur new research and development of effective therapies for PAD.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pulse harmonic analysis is a quantitative and objective methodology within traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) used to evaluate pulse characteristics. However, interpreting pulse wave data is challenging due to its inherent complexity. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review and comparison of existing human pulse wave harmonic analysis methods to elucidate their patterns and characteristics.\nMETHODS: A systematic review of clinical research reports published from 1990 to 2021 was conducted, focusing on variations in harmonic characteristics across different medical conditions and physiological states. Keyword searches included terms related to analysis methods (e.g., \"Pulse Spectrum,\" \"harmonic analysis,\" \"harmonic index\") and measured indicators (e.g., \"vascular response,\" \"PPG,\" \"Photoplethysmography,\" \"aortic,\" \"arterial,\" \"blood pressure\"). Supplementary research using PubMed's Mesh terms specifically targeted \"Pulse wave analysis\" within the methods and statistical analysis domain. Articles were filtered based on predefined criteria, including human participants and research related to pulse pressure or vascular volume changes. Conference papers, animal studies, and irrelevant research were excluded, with literature evaluation scales selected based on the retrieved research reports.\nRESULTS: Initially, 6487 research reports were identified, and after screening, 50 reports were included in the review. The analysis revealed that low-frequency harmonics increase following vigorous activity or sympathetic excitation but decrease during rest or parasympathetic excitation. Cardiovascular patients exhibited elevated first harmonics associated with the liver meridian, while diabetes patients displayed weakened third harmonics related to the spleen meridian. Liver dysfunction was linked to changes in the first harmonic, and cancer patients showed signs of liver and kidney yin deficiency in the first and second harmonics. These findings underscore the potential of harmonic analysis for TCM disease diagnosis and organ assessment. Moreover, individuals with conditions such as liver dysfunction, cancer, and gynecological disorders displayed distinct intensity patterns across harmonics one through ten compared to healthy controls, albeit with some variations. Heterogeneity in these studies mainly stemmed from differences in measurement methods and study populations. Additionally, research suggested that factors like blood circulation and cognitive activity influenced harmonic intensity.\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, this report consolidates prior research on pulse wave harmonics analysis, revealing unique patterns associated with various physiological conditions. Despite limitations, such as limited sample sizes in previous studies, the observed associations between physiological states and harmonics hold promise for potential clinical applications. This study lays a solid foundation for future applications of arterial wave harmonics analysis, promoting wider adoption of this analytical approach.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there are no ex vivo systems that can model the motion of peripheral arteries and allow for the evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK) of endovascular devices. The objective of this study was to develop a novel peripheral simulating bioreactor system to evaluate drug pharmacokinetics of stents. We utilized 3D-printed and off-the-shelf components to construct a peripheral-simulating bioreactor system capable of mimicking the motion of peripheral arteries. Servo motors were primarily used to shorten/elongate, twist, and bend explanted porcine carotid arteries. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics in the bioreactor, drug-eluting stents were deployed within explanted arteries and subjected to vascular motion along with pulsatile flow conditions. Following 30 min and 24 h, the arteries were removed, and paclitaxel levels were measured. Scanning electron microscopy was also performed to evaluate the stent surface. Arterial paclitaxel levels of the stent-treated arteries were found to be higher at 30 min than at 24 h following pulsatile and no vascular motion and even higher at 24 h following pulsatile flow and vascular motion. The residual drug on the stent significantly decreased from 30 min to 24 h. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the loss of paclitaxel coating at 24 h and greater disturbance in stents under peripheral motion versus pulsatile only. This system represents the first ex vivo system to determine the PK of drug-eluting stents under physiological flow and vascular motion conditions. This work provides a novel system for a quick and inexpensive preclinical tool to study acute drug tissue concentration kinetics of drug-releasing interventional vascular devices designed for peripheral applications.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have a significant risk of myocardial infarction and death secondary to concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD). This is particularly true in patients with critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) who exceed a 20% mortality rate at 6 months despite standard treatment with risk factor modification. Although systematic preoperative coronary testing is not recommended for patients with PAD without cardiac symptoms, the clinical manifestations of CAD are often muted in patients with CLTI due to poor mobility and activity intolerance. Thus, the true incidence and impact of \"silent\" CAD in a CLTI cohort is unknown. This study aims to determine the prevalence of ischemia-producing coronary artery stenosis in a CLTI cohort using coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) and computed tomography (CT)-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR), a noninvasive imaging modality that has shown significant correlation to cardiac catheterization in the detection of clinically relevant coronary ischemia.\nMETHODS: Patients presenting with newly diagnosed CLTI at our institution from May 2020 to April 2021 were screened for underlying CAD. Included subjects had no known history of CAD, no cardiac symptoms, and no anginal equivalent complaints at presentation. Patients underwent cCTA and FFR evaluation and were classified by the anatomic location and severity of CAD. Significant coronary ischemia was defined as FFR ≤0.80 distal to a >30% coronary stenosis, and severe coronary ischemia was documented at FFR ≤0.75, consistent with established guidelines.\nRESULTS: A total of 170 patients with CLTI were screened; 65 patients (38.2%) had no coronary symptoms and met all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Twenty-four patients (31.2%) completed cCTA and FFR evaluation. Forty-one patients have yet to complete testing secondary to socioeconomic factors (insurance denial, transportation inaccessibility, testing availability, etc). The mean age of included subjects was 65.4 ± 7.0 years, and 15 (62.5%) were male. Patients presented with ischemic rest pain (n = 7; 29.1%), minor tissue loss (n = 14; 58.3%) or major tissue loss (n = 3; 12.5%). Significant (≥50%) coronary artery stenosis was noted on cCTA in 19 of 24 patients (79%). Significant left main coronary artery stenosis was identified in two patients (10%). When analyzed with FFR, 17 patients (71%) had hemodynamically significant coronary ischemia (FFR ≤0.8), and 54% (n = 13) had lesion-specific severe coronary ischemia (FFR ≤0.75). The mean FFR in patients with coronary ischemia was 0.70 ± 0.07. Multi-vessel disease pattern was present in 53% (n = 9) of patients with significant coronary stenosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of cCTA-derived fractional flow reserve demonstrates a significant percentage of patients with CLTI have silent (asymptomatic) coronary ischemia. More than one-half of these patients have lesion-specific severe ischemia, which may be associated with increased mortality when treated solely with risk factor modification. cCTA and FFR diagnosis of significant coronary ischemia has the potential to improve cardiac care, perioperative morbidity, and long-term survival curves of patients with CLTI. Systemic improvements in access to care will be needed to allow for broad application of these imaging assessments should they prove universally valuable. Additional study is required to determine the benefit of selective coronary revascularization in patients with CLTI.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: the rising prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) around the world has dramatically increased the number of people bearing the complications of this potentially incapacitating disease. One of these complications is foot ulcers that may result in amputation. This study sets out to determine the profiles of the \"foot-at-risk\" for ulceration and the associated socio-medical factors in DM patients.\nMETHODS: this study was conducted at Bowen University Teaching Hospital, Ogbomoso, Southwest, Nigeria. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study comprising 299 outpatient adults aged 18 years and above with diabetes mellitus of at least 6 months in duration. Comprehensive Foot Examination and Risk Assessment tool was used to identify the foot-at-risk categories of the participants. Data analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.\nRESULTS: the prevalence of foot-at-risk among the participants was 64.9% (194). Among the 194 participants with foot-at-risk, 35.1% (105) belonged to the foot-at-risk categories 0, 37.8% (113) in category 1, 16.1% (48) in category 2, and 11.0% (33) in category 3. Other factors that had a statistically significant association with foot-at-risk included; age, religion, level of education, duration of diabetes, history of smoking, and glycemic control.\nCONCLUSION: foot-at-risk was found to have an alarming prevalence among the participants. In addition, the level of glycemic control in this group was unacceptably poor. Clinicians need to intensify preventive measures like foot screening and health education to prevent foot ulcerations, which may result in limb amputation in DM patients.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral artery (PAD) disease in association with renal artery stenosis is an important association which predicts the severity of the disease. An increase in the number of vessels affected by peripheral artery disease increases the chances of renal artery stenosis. In our case, the patient had primarily presented with anginal chest pain with complaints of claudication which on further investigation was diagnosed to be a triple vessel coronary artery disease along with bilateral subclavian and bilateral renal stenosis. On detailed history taking, risk factors like hypertension and chronic smoking was found to be present in our case which predisposed to peripheral artery disease secondary to atherosclerosis which was diagnosed on further investigations. Although the association of renal artery stenosis is not very rare in cases of severe peripheral vascular diseases, the presence of a triple vessel coronary artery disease in synchrony is what makes it unique. Take away lesson from this case report is importance of early diagnosis of dyslipidemia causing atherosclerosis and its complications. Multiple atherosclerotic lesions in synchrony i.e, bilateral renal artery stenosis with bilateral subclavian artery stenosis with coronary artery triple vessel atherosclerotic disease like in our case and its severity should create awareness among health care individuals and early treatment measures including lifestyle modifications should be considered to avoid such drastic events.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Clinical verification of rheumatoid vasculitis (RV) persists as a mid-to-late diagnosis with medical imaging or biopsy. Early and subclinical presentations of RV, in particular, can remain underdiagnosed in the absence of adequate diagnostic testing. In this study, the research demonstrated the precursory changes for RV in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using non-invasive ultrasound imaging of a peripheral vessel.\nMETHOD: Six participants were recruited: three participants with (RA) and three age- and gender-matched healthy controls. All participants completed a Foot Health Survey Questionnaire (FHSQ), and participants with RA completed a Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index-5 (RADAI-5). Bilateral B-mode and Doppler ultrasound of the dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) was performed. The degree of inflammation, lumen and artery diameters, lumen diameter-to-artery diameter ratio and peak systolic velocity in the proximal DPA were compared between the two groups.\nRESULTS: The mean RADAI-5 score (5.4 ± 0.8 out of 10) indicated moderate disease activity amongst participants with RA. Inflammation was observed in the DPA wall in all participants with RA, compared to no inflammation observed in the control group (Friedmans two-way analysis: χ = 15.733, P = 0.003). Differences between groups for inflammation, lumen diameter and lumen diameter-to-artery diameter ratio were found (P < 0.034), without differences for artery diameter and peak systolic velocity (P > 0.605). DPA wall inflammation did not correlate with FHSQ scores ( = -0.770, P = 0.073).\nCONCLUSION: Despite moderate RA disease activity, this is the first study to demonstrate the use of ultrasound to observe inflammation in small vessel disease. Our findings suggest ultrasound imaging may be a viable screening tool to demonstrate arterial wall inflammation, indicating the precursory changes of RV.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to stablish cut-off of early diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy (PDN) based on neuropathy symptom score (NSS) and neuropathy disability score (NDS); to determine the behavior of NDD and NDS in patients with and without PDN; and to verify the association between clinical and demographic variables with both tests.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort included 86 patients with diabetes. The NSS and NDS evaluations were collected in medical records in two moments: initial (entry into service) and final (after three years). Individuals were categorized in three groups: G1- PDN in both evaluations (N = 27); G2- PDN only in the final evaluation (N = 16); G3-individuals without PDN (N = 43). A ROC curve was performed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of NSS and NDS for PDN diagnosis. ANOVA was used to compare NSS and NDS between groups and evaluations, and multiple regression was performed to find predictors of PDN.\nRESULTS: The NSS and NDS showed excellent sensitivity and specificity (NDS ≥1.5 and NSS ≥6.5) for PDN diagnosis. There was a significant difference between groups in initial (p = 0.000) and final (p = 0.000) NDS and NSS evaluations. There was an association between peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and increase in NSS (p = 0.024) in G2; and association between loss of protective sensation (LOPS) and increase in NSS in G3 (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: NSS and NDS tests showed excellent sensitivity and specificity for early PDN diagnosis. Behavior of both tests can differ patients with and without PDN. Furthermore, PAD and LOPS can be a predictor of PDN evolution.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects a substantial proportion of the global population, particularly older individuals, affecting around 200 million people worldwide highlighting its significant impact on human health. Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most severe clinical presentation of PAD characterized by ischemic rest pain tissue ulceration or gangrene. The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of infra popliteal angioplasty (in terms of wound healing and limb salvage) in patients with below-the-knee total chronic occlusion (TCO).\nMETHODS: In this cross-sectional study, all consecutive patients in one year with TCO and fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included.\nRESULTS: A total of 64 limbs underwent angioplasty. The mean age was 55.38 ± 13.12 (Range 22-88) years and there were 73% (n=47) males. Diabetes mellitus was the most prevalent risk factor in 59.4% (n=38) of patients. 48.4 % (n=31) of patients had below-knee TCO in all three arteries. Technical Success was achieved in 95.3% (n=61/64). All 3 patients who had technical failure ended up with below-the-knee amputation. Furthermore, 2 more patients who had technical success also ended up with below-the-knee amputation. The difference between these two rates was significant (100% vs 3.3%; p-value =0.004). In terms of wound healing, statistically significant improvement was noted within the first 6 months (p-value = 0.05). The limb salvage rate was 90.6% (n=59/64). The primary patency rate was 81.3% (n=52) and 76.6% (n=49) at 6 and 12 months respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty results in statistically significant wound healing leading to a higher limb salvage rate, in patients with TCO of infrapopliteal arteries.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The level of awareness of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in Saudi Arabia, especially among populations at high risk, is not currently well known. Therefore, our objective was to assess the existing level of awareness among patients who are at high risk of PAD, as well as their comprehension of the disease.\nMETHOD: An interview-based cross-sectional study included 1035 participants with risk factors for PAD and collected data on demographics and knowledge domains related to PAD.\nRESULTS: The statistical analysis was performed using -tests and ANOVA. Overall, participants exhibited poor knowledge, with a mean score of 5.7 out of 26. The highest scores were observed in the risk factor and preventive measure domains, with means of 1.8 out of 7 and 1.8 out of 6, respectively. The factors associated with higher knowledge scores included older age, male gender, higher education, healthcare profession, interviews in vascular settings, previous awareness of PAD, and prior cardio-cerebrovascular interventions.\nCONCLUSION: This study underscores the inadequate knowledge of PAD among high-risk individuals. Targeted educational initiatives are essential to bridge this knowledge gap, potentially reducing the burden of PAD-related complications and improving patient outcomes. Efforts should focus on raising awareness about PAD, particularly among high-risk populations.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Surgical treatment is associated with an unwanted response of the organism to the so-called surgical trauma. This response is called surgical stress. Ischaemia-reperfusion injury is one of essential causes of tissue damage. It comprises functional and structural changes in tissue that occur after the restoration of circulation, after an episode of ischaemia. Necrosis of irreversibly changed cells and endothelial and mitochondrial-induced tissue swelling occur.\nMETHODS: Physiology, pathophysiology of endothelial glycocalyx: Endothelial glycocalyx is a 0.2 to 5 micrometres thin heteropolysaccharide layer that covers the endothelium on its intraluminal side. Backbone molecules of the glycocalyx include proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycosaminoglycans. Damage of the endothelial glycocalyx was described in trauma patients, in patients with septic shock, in ischemia and reperfusion injury, and during extensive surgical procedures. Approaches to prevent endothelial glycocalyx damage: Remote ischemic preconditioning was tested as a method of ischemia and reperfusion injury prevention during and after surgery. Nevertheless, the expected effect was not confirmed in performed meta-analyses. Endothelial glycocalyx damage can be prevented pharmacologically with a broad spectrum of substances, such as antithrombin III, doxycycline, hydrocortisone, etanercept, or nitric oxide donors. Hydrogen inhalation or albumin affects glycocalyx positively. Sulodexide provides a positive effect on the protection and reparation of endothelial glycocalyx. This proteoglycan with antithrombotic, fibrinolytic, hypofibrinogenemic, and lipolytic function is used for the treatment of venous diseases, ischaemic heart disease, and peripheral arterial disease. A positive effect of sulodexide on renal dysfunction was documented in a model of ischaemia and reperfusion injury. Equally, a positive effect of sulodexide was described on endothelium repair after its mechanical damage.\nCONCLUSION: Further research needs to be performed to evaluate the effect of endothelium-protectives on glycocalyx damage prevention and repair in ischaemia and reperfusion models involving large laboratory animals or in clinical trials in patients undergoing surgical revascularisation procedures.",

    "abstract": "Cilostazol is a selective cyclic inhibitor of the 3-phosphodiesterase type (PDE3) that is recommended to be administered in cases of symptomatic peripheral vascular disease (YEI). It was discovered as a chemical compound in the 1980s, in Takao Nishi laboratory in Japan.  The purpose of the present review was to evaluate the efficacy of cilostazol administration in a YEI with intermittent claudication or moderate to severe lower extremity ischemia. A systematic review of the literature was carried out where articles were searched in the international database PubMed. The year 2005 was set as a time limit for the publication date of the articles. The following keywords were used: cilostazol, peripheral arterial disease, revascularization and lower limb. A total of 95 articles were found, of which only 10 were selected for the present study. According to the results of the current review, the use of cilostazol increases the ability to walk, improves the quality of life, reduces the rates of re-narrowing of vessels and stents, reduces the likelihood of amputation and is co-administered with other antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents. Cilostazol administration should be a possible treatment option for symptomatic YEI. Further research is necessary to determine its safety after three years.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Epidemiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease might be different in patients with polygenic hypercholesterolemia plus high levels (≥30 mg/dl) of Lp(a) (H-Lpa) than in those with polygenic hypercholesterolemia alone (H-LDL). We compared the incidence of peripheral artery disease (PAD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in patients with H-Lpa and in those with H-LDL.\nMETHODS: Retrospective analysis of demographics, risk factors, vascular events, therapy, and lipid profile in outpatient clinical data. Inclusion criteria was adult age, diagnosis of polygenic hypercholesterolemia, and both indication and availability for Lp(a) measurement.\nRESULTS: Medical records of 258 patients with H-Lpa and 290 H-LDL were reviewed for occurrence of vascular events. The median duration of follow-up was 10 years (IQR 3-16). In spite of a similar reduction of LDL cholesterol, vascular events occurred more frequently, and approximately 7 years earlier ( = 0.024) in patients with H-Lpa than in H-LDL (HR 1.96 1.21-3.17,  = 0.006). The difference was around 10 years for acute events (TIA, Stroke, acute coronary events) and one year for chronic ones ( = 0.023 and 0.525, respectively). Occurrence of acute CAD was higher in H-Lpa men (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-7.9,  = 0.007) while, among women, PAD was observed exclusively in H-Lpa subjects with smoking habits ( = 0.009).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with high Lp(a) levels suffer from a larger and earlier burden of the disease compared to those with polygenic hypercholesterolemia alone. These patients are at higher risk of CAD if they are men, and of PAD if they are women.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) impacts more than 200 million people worldwide. The understanding of the genetics of the disease and its clinical implications continue to evolve. This systematic review provides a comprehensive summary of all DNA variants that have been studied in association with the diagnosis and progression of PAD, with a meta-analysis of the ones replicated in the literature.\nMETHODS: A systematic review of all studies examining DNA variants associated with the diagnosis and progression of PAD was performed. Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were included. A meta-analysis of 13 variants derived from earlier smaller candidate gene studies of the diagnosis of PAD was performed. The literature on the progression of PAD was limited, and a meta-analysis was not feasible because of the heterogeneity in the criteria used to characterize it.\nRESULTS: A total of 231 DNA variants in 112 papers were studied for the association with the diagnosis of PAD. There were significant variations in the definition of PAD and the selection of controls in the various studies. GWAS have established 19 variants associated with the diagnosis of PAD that were replicated in several large patient cohorts. Only variants in intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (rs5498), IL-6 (rs1800795), and hepatic lipase (rs2070895) showed significant association with the diagnosis of PAD. However, these variants were not noted in the published GWAS.\nCONCLUSIONS: Genetic research in the diagnosis of PAD has significant heterogeneity, but recent GWAS have demonstrated variants consistently associated with the disease. More research focusing on the progression of PAD is needed to identify patients at risk of adverse events and develop strategies that would improve their outcomes.",

There are currently no clinical methods available to determine the muscular damage induced by chronic mal-perfusion. This monocentric prospective cross-sectional study investigated n = 193 adults, healthy to severe PAD, in order to quantify the degree of calf muscle degeneration caused by PAD using a non-invasive hybrid ultrasound and single wavelength optoacoustic imaging (US/SWL-OAI) approach. While US provides morphologic information, SWL-OAI visualizes the absorption of pulsed laser light and the resulting sound waves from molecules undergoing thermoelastic expansion. US/SWL-OAI was compared to multispectral data, clinical disease severity, angiographic findings, phantom experiments, and histological examinations from calf muscle biopsies. We were able to show that synergistic use of US/SWL-OAI is most likely to map clinical degeneration of the muscle and progressive PAD.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic true aneurysm of the distal radial artery is a rare disease with only few reported cases. Most patients were treated surgically with proximal and distal arterial ligatures, while there are reports of only 7 cases where revascularization procedures were performed. We present a case of a 66-year-old man with a pulsatile mass in the right forearm at the location of the radial artery. Six months preceding the presentation, the patient had first noticed a pulsatile tumefaction which gradually increased in size, with a sudden increase during the last month. The patient worked as a waiter and was a non-smoker with no significant comorbidities. There was no history of trauma, recent infection, hospitalization, recurrent injury, or peripheral venous cannulation. After CDT diagnosis, we performed resection of aneurysm and reconstruction with cephalic autovenous graft. One month afterwards, at the follow-up visit, the patient denied having symptoms of hand ischemia and duplex ultrasound examination showed adequate patency of the radial artery. This paper presents a rare case of a true idiopathic radial artery aneurysm that was treated surgically by complete resection and interposition with a reverse cephalic vein autovenous graft. Detailed anamnesis and clinical examination are necessary for the appropriate surgical treatment of the disease.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Statins remain the first-line treatment for secondary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) events, with lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) being their therapeutic target. Although LDL-C reduction significantly lowers CV risk, residual risk persists, even in patients with well-controlled LDL-C; thus, statin add-on agents that target pathways other than LDL-C, such as the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid, may help to further reduce persistent CV risk in patients with established CV disease.\nMETHODS: This narrative review examines the contemporary literature assessing intermediate- and long-term event rates in patients with established CV disease treated with statins.\nRESULTS: CV event rates among patients treated with statins who have established CV disease, including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral arterial disease, accumulate over time, with a cumulative incidence of CV events reaching up to approximately 40% over 10 years. Recurrent stroke occurs in up to 19% of patients seven years after a first cerebrovascular event. Repeat revascularization and CV-related death occurs in up to 38% and 33% of patients with peripheral artery disease after three years, respectively.\nDISCUSSION: Additional treatment strategies, such as eicosapentaenoic acid, are needed to reduce persistent CV risk in patients with established CV disease treated with statins.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) and non-compressible artery disease (NCAD) constitute predictors of subclinical atherosclerosis easily assessed through the ankle brachial index (ABI). Although both diseases show substantial genetic influences, few genetic association studies have focused on the ABI and PAD, and none have focused on NCAD. To overcome these limitations, we assessed the role of several candidate genes on the ABI, both in its continuous distribution and in the clinical manifestations associated to its extreme values: PAD and NCAD. We examined 13 candidate genomic regions in 1606 participants from the ARTPER study, a prospective population-based cohort, with the ABI assessed through ultrasonography. Association analyses were conducted independently for individuals with PAD (ABI < 0.9) or with NCAD (ABI > 1.4) vs. healthy participants. After including potential covariates and correction for multiple testing, minor alleles in the genetic markers rs10757278 and rs1333049, both in the 9p21.3 region, were significantly associated with a decreased risk of NCAD. Associations with the ABI showed limited support to these results. No significant associations were detected for PAD. The locus 9p21.3 constitutes the first genetic locus associated with NCAD, an assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis feasible for implementation in primary healthcare settings that has been systematically neglected from genetic studies.",

A 90-year-old man was brought to the emergency department with fever, low SpO, and effortful breathing. Arterial blood gas analysis showed that PaCO levels had accumulated to 120 mmHg. Although CT showed marked thickening of the bronchial wall from the central to the peripheral region, the cause was unknown. At the family's request, the patient was not placed on a ventilator, and treatment was started with steroids alone. After admission, the patient's condition improved with only intravenous steroids, and he was discharged to the facility with continued oral steroid medication. After a short treatment period, the possibility of relapsing polychondritis was considered and confirmed. The patient met Levine's diagnostic criteria, with findings of destruction of the bilateral auricular cartilage and the airway and a response to steroid administration. Although it is very difficult to diagnose relapsing polychondritis at the initial emergency department visit, early administration of steroids is worth trying in patients with asphyxia with extensive thickening of the airway on CT findings, as relapsing polychondritis may be considered, and early steroid administration may improve patient symptoms.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study explored the experiences and acceptability of a novel, home-based, walking exercise behaviour-change intervention (MOtivating Structured walking Activity in people with Intermittent Claudication (MOSAIC)) in adults with Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD).\nDESIGN AND SETTING: Individual semi-structured audio-recorded interviews were conducted with adults with Peripheral Arterial Disease who had completed the MOSAIC intervention as part of a randomised clinical trial. Data were analysed using inductive reflexive thematic analysis and interpreted using the seven-construct theoretical framework of acceptability of healthcare interventions (TFA).\nPARTICIPANTS: Twenty participants (mean age (range) 67(54-80) years, 70% male, 55% White British) were interviewed.\nRESULTS: One central theme was identified: Acceptability of walking exercise as a treatment. This theme was explained by four linked themes: Exploring walking exercise with a knowledgeable professional, Building confidence with each step, Towards self-management-learning strategies to continue walking and The impact of walking exercise. These themes were interpreted using six of the seven TFA constructs: affective attitude, burden, perceived effectiveness, intervention coherence, opportunity costs, and self-efficacy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Participants perceived MOSAIC as an effective, acceptable, and low burden intervention. Physiotherapists were regarded as knowledgeable and supportive professionals who helped participants understand PAD and walking exercise as a treatment. Participants developed confidence to self-manage their condition and their symptoms. As participants confidence and walking capacity improved, they expanded their activities and gained a more positive outlook on their future. MOSAIC is an acceptable intervention that may facilitate adoption of and access to exercise for people with PAD.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There has existed controversy regarding the use of Ginkgo biloba (GKB) for blood metabolism among type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) patients, and we tried to analyze the effects and safety of GKB on T2DM patients.\nMETHODS: We conducted a literature search between January 2003 and December 2022 of seven online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure). A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed to compare the effects and safety of GKB among T2DM patients. Four groups of parameters were extracted and analyzed: hemorheology parameters, lipid profile, glycemic control markers, and adverse events.\nRESULTS: In the end, 13 eligible articles with 11 indicators among 1573 patients were included. In the hemorheology parameters section, GKB showed significantly lower plasma viscosity (PV) (SMD=-0.91, 95%CI [-1.45, -0.36], <0.01) and hematocrit (Hct) (SMD=-0.60, 95%CI [-0.97, -0.24], <0.01) than the control group. GKB shoed higher velocity of the dorsalis pedis artery (VDPA) (SMD=0.51, 95%CI [0.26, 0.76], <0.01) and ankle brachial index (ABI) (SMD=0.71, 95%CI [0.32, 1.10], <0.01) than the control. In both the lipid profile and glycemic control markers sections, we did not find any difference between GKB and control groups, including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and fasting serum glucose (FSG). In addition, we saw no difference in adverse events (AE). The sensitivity analysis and funnel plot showed that the results in this research were robust and had no publication bias.\nCONCLUSION: In conclusion, GKB might safely reduce the risk of peripheral arterial or even systemic cardiovascular disease. However, GKB did not directly improve lipid and blood glucose levels in T2DM patients.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: https://inplasy.com/, identifier INPLASY202350096.",

Despite being initially developed and indicated for high-surgical-risk patients, it is now offered to low-risk populations based on the results of large randomized controlled trials. The most common access sites in the vast majority of patients undergoing TAVI are the common femoral arteries; however, 10-20% of the patients treated with TAVI require an alternative access route, mainly due to peripheral atherosclerotic disease or complex anatomy. Hence, to achieve successful delivery and implantation of the valve, several arterial approaches have been studied, including transcarotid (TCr), axillary/subclavian (A/Sc), transapical (TAp), transaortic (TAo), suprasternal-brachiocephalic (S-B), and transcaval (TCv). This review aims to concisely summarize the most recent literature data and current guidelines as well as evaluate the various access routes for TAVI, focusing on the indications, the various special patient groups, and the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, as well as their adverse events.",

This study utilizes non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor knee-level microcirculation in ECMO patients. After processing oxygenation data, machine learning distinguishes high and low disease severity in the veno-venous (VV-ECMO) and veno-arterial (VA-ECMO) groups, with two clinical parameters enhancing the model performance. Both ECMO modes show promise in the clinical severity diagnosis. The research further explores statistical correlations between the oxygenation data and disease severity in diverse physiological conditions, revealing moderate correlations with the acute physiologic and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) scores in the VV-ECMO and VA-ECMO groups. NIRS holds the potential for assessing patient condition improvements.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance (AR) associated with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) poses additional challenges for the management of ischemic leg ulcers, increasing the likelihood of severe outcomes. This study assessed AR prevalence in bacteria isolated from CLTI-associated leg ulcers before (1 January 2017-10 March 2020;  = 69) and during (11 March 2020-31 December 2022;  = 59) the COVID-19 pandemic from patients admitted with positive wound cultures to a regional hospital in Chiang Mai (Thailand). There was a marked reduction in AR rates from 78% pre-pandemic to 42% during the pandemic ( < 0.0001), with rates of polymicrobial infections 22 percentage points lower (from 61% to 39%, respectively;  = 0.014). There were reduced AR rates to amoxicillin/clavulanate (from 42% to 4%;  < 0.0001) and ampicillin (from 16% to 2%;  = 0.017), as well as multidrug resistance (19% to 8%;  = 0.026). Factors associated with increased AR odds were polymicrobial infections (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.6 (95% CI 2.1, 15.0);  = 0.001), gram-negative bacteria (aOR 7.0 (95% CI 2.4, 20.5);  < 0.001), and prior use of antibiotics (aOR 11.9 (95% CI 1.1, 128.2);  = 0.041). Improvements in infection control measures and hygiene practices in the community during the pandemic were likely key factors contributing to lower AR rates. Thus, strategic public health interventions, including community education on hygiene and the informed use of antibiotics, may be crucial in mitigating the challenges posed by AR in CLTI. Further, advocating for more judicious use of empirical antibiotics in clinical settings can balance effective treatment against AR development, thereby improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction has been well documented in this population. The sympathetic nervous system contributes to beat-to-beat blood pressure regulation primarily by baroreflex control of the peripheral vasculature which may be impaired in females with RRMS. Even at rest, attenuated sympathetic control of vasomotor tone may result in large and frequent blood pressure excursions (i.e., greater blood pressure variability). Therefore, the primary purpose of this investigation was to test the following hypotheses; (1) females with RRMS have augmented beat-to-beat blood pressure variability compared to healthy controls and (2) reduced sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity in females with RRMS is related to augmented blood pressure variability.\nMETHODS: Electrocardiogram and beat-to-beat blood pressure were continuously recorded during 8-10 min of supine rest in 26 females with clinically definite RRMS and 24 sex-, age- and BMI- matched healthy controls. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) was recorded in a subset of participants (MS, n = 15; CON, n = 14). Traditional statistical measurements of dispersions were used to index beat-to-beat blood pressure variability. Spontaneous sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity was quantified by sorting diastolic blood pressures into 3 mmHg bins and calculating MSNA burst incidence within each bin. Weighted linear regression was then used to account for the number of cardiac cycles in each bin and calculate slopes. Spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity was determined using the sequence method.\nRESULTS: Groups had similar resting mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), MSNA burst frequency and MSNA burst incidence (All P > 0.05). The standard deviation and interquartile range of MAP, SBP and DBP were less in females with RRMS compared to healthy controls (All P < 0.05). There were no between groups differences in sympathetic baroreflex sensitivity or cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (Both P > 0.05) and baroreflex sensitivity measures were not related to any indices of blood pressure variability (Both P > 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: These data suggest that females with RRMS have reduced beat-to-beat blood pressure variability. However, this does not appear to be related to changes in sympathetic or cardiac baroreflex sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple clinical studies have found a significant correlation between elevated galectin-3 (Gal-3) in circulation and the diagnosis and severity of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The current study used the Mendelian randomization (MR) technique to evaluate the possible causal relationship between Gal-3 and PAD.\nMETHODS: Genome-wide association study (GWAS) data of Gal-3 and PAD were obtained through the MR-Base platform. Then, using Gal-3 as the exposure and PAD as the outcome, a two-sample MR analysis was performed utilizing several regression techniques, including MR-Egger regression, inverse variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and weighted mode.\nRESULTS: Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified and designated as instrumental variables (IVs) that exhibited significant correlations with Gal-3 (linkage disequilibrium  < 0.001;  < 5 × 10). Various statistical methods showed that there was an absence of a significant link between Gal-3 and PAD (IVW: odds ratio (OR) = 0.9869, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.8792-1.1078,  = 0.8232). In addition, the presence of genetic pleiotropy did impact the putative causal relationship between PAD and Gal-3 (MR-Egger intercept = 0.0099,  = 0.659).\nCONCLUSIONS: There is no current evidence to establish a causal relationship between the level of Gal-3 in circulation and PAD.",

However, there are many peripheral sources of contamination through which concentrations of these metabolites can be raised or lowered after leaving the brain and entering the central venous pool. This raises the issue of potential false conclusions that could lead to erroneous diagnosis or research findings. We propose the use of simultaneous sampling of internal jugular venous and arterial blood to calculate veno-arterial gradient, which can reveal either a surplus or a deficit of metabolites exiting the brain. Methods for sampling internal jugular venous and arterial blood are described along with examples of the use of the veno-arterial gradient in non-AD brain research. Such methods in turn could help better establish the accuracy of forearm venous biomarkers.",

We now examine mutations in another CHIP gene,  , in PAH.\nMETHODS: We assessed  mutation prevalence in PAH Biobank subjects as compared with controls, first using whole exome sequencing (WES)-derived CHIP calls in 1832 PAH Biobank patients versus 7509 age-and sex-matched gnomAD controls. We then performed deep, targeted panel sequencing of CHIP genes on a subset of 710 PAH Biobank patients and compared the prevalence of  mutations therein to an independent pooled control cohort (N = 3645). In another cohort of 80 PAH patients and 41 controls,  mRNA expression was studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Finally, we evaluated the development of PAH in a conditional, hematopoietic,  knockout mouse model.\nRESULTS: mutations were more frequent in PAH cases versus control subjects in the WES dataset (OR 2.60, 95% CI: 1.71-4.27). Among PAH patients, 33 had  variants, most of whom had APAH (21/33). While 21/33 had somatic mutations (female:male 17:4), germline variants occurred in 12/33 (female:male 11:1). Hemodynamics were comparable with and without  mutations (mPAP=58±21 vs. 52±18 mmHg); however, patients with  mutations were unresponsive to acute vasodilator testing. Targeted panel sequencing identified that 14.6% of PAH patients had CHIP mutations (104/710), with  accounting for 49/104. There was a significant association between all CHIP mutations and PAH in analyses adjusted for age and sex (OR 1.40, 95% CI: 1.09-1.80), though  CHIP alone was not significantly enriched (OR:1.15, 0.82-1.61).  expression was reduced in patient-derived versus control PAH-PBMCs. Spontaneous PAH developed in  mice, and it was exacerbated by 3 weeks of hypoxia.  mice had increased lung macrophages and elevated plasma IL-13.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Microvascular dysfunction underlies many cardiovascular disease conditions; little is known regarding its presence in individuals with high levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. The aim of the present study was to determine the frequency of microvascular dysfunction among such subjects with and without concomitant familial hypercholesterolemia (FH).\nMETHODS: Four groups of asymptomatic individuals aged 30-59 years, without manifest cardiovascular disease, were recruited (n = 30 per group): controls with Lp(a) < 30 nmol/L, mutation-confirmed FH with Lp(a) < 30 nmol/L, or >125 nmol/L, and individuals with isolated Lp(a) > 125 nmol/L. Participants underwent evaluation of myocardial microvascular function by measuring coronary flow reserve (CFR) using transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, and of peripheral microvascular endothelial function by peripheral arterial tonometry.\nRESULTS: The groups were balanced in age, sex, and body mass index. Each of the three dyslipoproteinaemic groups had a greater proportion of individuals with impaired coronary flow reserve, 30%, compared to 6.7% of controls (p = 0.014). The median CFR levels did not differ significantly between the four groups, however. Cholesterol-lowering treatment time was longer in the individuals with normal than in those with impaired CFR in the FH + Lp(a) > 125 group (p = 0.023), but not in the group with FH + Lp(a) < 30 (p = 0.468). There was no difference in peripheral endothelial function between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Coronary microvascular dysfunction is more prevalent in asymptomatic individuals with isolated Lp(a) elevation and in heterozygous FH both with and without high Lp(a) compared to healthy controls. Cholesterol-lowering treatment could potentially prevent the development of microvascular dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Patients with ischemic stroke and branch atheromatous disease (BAD) have worse neurological deficits and prognoses than those with small vessel occlusion (SVO). However, both disorders are forms of deep brain infarctions. This study aimed to investigate an MRI-based etiological classification for isolated pontine infarctions and assess differences in vascular risk factors and peripheral arterial disease among etiological subtypes. Consecutive data of patients admitted for acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack between August 2016 and July 2019 were reviewed. Acute isolated pontine infarcts were classified into 3 groups: BAD, SVO, and large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), according to basilar or vertebral artery steno-occlusion and the extent of the infarct lesion on the basal pontine surface as displayed on magnetic resonance imaging and angiography. Vascular risk factors, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity were analyzed in the 3 groups. Among 64 enrolled patients, BAD was the most common cause of isolated pontine infarct. The BAD group had a higher frequency of abnormal ABI and hypertension than the SVO group. The BAD group had abnormal ABI and hyperlipidemia more frequently than the LAA group. No significant difference was found in diabetes or brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity incidence between the BAD and SVO groups. ABI and vascular risk factors in the BAD group were more similar to those in the LAA group than to those in the SVD group. This finding suggests that pontine lesions extending to the basal pontine surface have an atherosclerotic mechanism in BAD, requiring potent antiplatelet therapy for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Hypothenar hammer syndrome (HHS) is a rare vascular disorder leading to ulnar artery thrombosis or aneurysm and causing acute or chronic limb ischemia. The optimal approaches to managing this condition lack a definitive consensus and are essentially empirical, typically necessitating conservative methods for symptomatic relief, with surgical intervention reserved for cases for which conservative measures prove inadequate or when acute limb ischemia ensues. Limited data are available on percutaneous management for this condition. We present the case of a 36-year-old male powerlifter who developed acute digital ischemia due to HHS in the left hand that was managed successfully through an innovative approach using antegrade left brachial artery access and combining percutaneous thrombosuction and intra-arterial thrombolysis. This comprehensive approach resulted in restoration of blood flow and resolution of acute limb ischemia. The patient was subsequently prescribed short-term anticoagulation therapy and remained symptom free at 3 months of follow-up. This innovative strategy challenges traditional surgical approaches in HHS management, underscoring the importance of using minimally invasive techniques as a promising alternative and highlighting potential avenues for further research.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease, the prevalence of which is constantly increasing worldwide. It is often burdened by disabling comorbidities that reduce the quality and expectancy of life of the affected individuals. The traditional complications of diabetes are generally described as macrovascular complications (e.g., coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, and stroke), and microvascular complications (e.g., diabetic kidney disease, retinopathy, and neuropathy). Recently, due to advances in diabetes management and the increased life expectancy of diabetic patients, a strong correlation between diabetes and other pathological conditions (such as liver diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive impairments, and sleep disorders) has emerged. Therefore, these comorbidities have been proposed as emerging complications of diabetes. P66 is a redox protein that plays a role in oxidative stress, apoptosis, glucose metabolism, and cellular aging. It can be regulated by various stressful stimuli typical of the diabetic milieu and is involved in various types of organ and tissue damage under diabetic conditions. Although its role in the pathogenesis of diabetes remains controversial, there is strong evidence regarding the involvement of p66 in the traditional complications of diabetes. In this review, we will summarize the evidence supporting the role of p66 in the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications, focusing for the first time on the emerging complications of diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Protein-energy wasting is associated with inflammation and advanced atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. We enrolled 800 patients who had undergone successful lower-extremity revascularization, and we investigated the association among the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI) as a surrogate marker of protein-energy wasting, C-reactive protein (CRP), and their joint roles in predicting amputation and mortality. They were divided into lower, middle, and upper tertiles (T1, T2, and T3) according to GNRI and CRP levels, respectively. Regarding the results, the amputation-free survival rates over 8 years were 47.0%, 56.9%, and 69.5% in T1, T2, and T3 of the GNRI and 65.8%, 58.7%, and 33.2% for T1, T2, and T3 of CRP, respectively ( < 0.0001 for both). A reduced GNRI [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-2.59,  = 0.0016 for T1 vs. T3] and elevated CRP (aHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.30-2.70,  = 0.0007 for T3 vs. T1) independently predicted amputation and/or mortality. When the two variables were combined, the risk was 3.77-fold higher (95% CI 1.97-7.69,  < 0.0001) in patients who occupied both T1 of the GNRI and T3 of CRP than in those who occupied both T3 of the GNRI and T1 of CRP. In conclusion, patients with preprocedurally decreased GNRI and elevated CRP levels frequently experienced amputation and mortality, and a combination of these two variables could more accurately stratify the risk.",
